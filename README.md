# Quidditch
Here we were assigned to create a working leaderboard and bracket that distributed scores randomly and also factored in the fifteen-percent chance of winning the game by catching the "Golden Snitch". At the end of each round, the computer would read out the remaining teams until only two remained. It then would display the winner.
